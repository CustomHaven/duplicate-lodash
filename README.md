# Lodash - duplicated practise version

Lodash is a library not created by us here we are just taking this library and creating one for ourselves.

## Introduction

Lodash makes JavaScript easier and takes the heavy work of iterating over arrays, objects, numbers, strings etc.

## Technology

JavaScript:

- Iterating arrays, objects and strings
- Manipulating and testing values
- Creating composite functions

# Launch

You can just fork this repository and use it on your projects. But we highly recommend that you go to the original Lodash instead for more functions they have mad all functions we have at the moments are:

- .clamp()
- .inRange()
- .words()
- .pad()
- .has()
- .invert()
- .findKey()
- .drop()
- .dropWhile()
- .chunk()

If you want to test any of these function run:

**node test/test-all.js**
